# LightWeightMTGProxy
Generating lightweight proxies for playtesting new Magic The Gathering decks at home

----

This project came out of a want for a quick, easy, simple, and cheap way to print Proxy cards at home for Magic: The Gathering.
Many of the tools found online at the time were based on high-res scans and the ones that weren't looked nothing like magic cards.
Our goal was to have something in the middle, a card that looked and felt familiar but was obviously not real and didn't use up all your ink.

The project accepts deck lists in the form of CSV's. It ignores the top line and assumes the first two columns are Quantity and Name respectively.

HUGE shoutout to http://mtgjson.com/ for making this as effortless as possible.
